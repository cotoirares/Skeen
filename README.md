# Skeen - Keen to help your skin!

"Skeen" was the first software project I ever took part of. The idea came back in 2020 during the pandemic (when I was only 15 years old), during a 6-month programme called "Academia DpIT". Back then, I was placed in a team with 5 other high school students and received guidance from 2 Software Developers working at an IT firm in Cluj (in our case, NTT Data).

The app was designed to solve a widespread problem among people: <b>The slowness with which medical issues are being solved in the public health system.</b> Skeen was to diagnose a skin disease based on a simple photo uploaded in the app, using an <b>AI-trained</b> model. The app had also a "disease advice" section, which indicated for each disease what can be done in the short term and whether the user should consult a specialist or not. In this way, the simple questions of the patients could be solved easily using Skeen and not going directly to the hospital.

The second phase of the development implicated doctors' input. For the serious diagnostics, we intended to create a <b> key platform patient-doctor </b> such as, through our app, every patient could contact a doctor that would have received their initial diagnostic (given by the app) once the conversation started. The start-up was meant to collaborate with specialised doctors in this sense.

The whole start-up included the Android app (developed by me and one other colleague, Raul using Java and XML), the Desktop app (developed by 2 other colleagues, using Python and PyQT) and a presentation website (developed by me and one other colleague, Paul). The mobile and desktop apps were both using the same AI model we trained (on Microsoft Azure) using datasets published by Harvard University.

My main input was developing the Android app, hence the code available here is exactly that app. Working at this start-up was my first contact in applying informatics in real contexts and I learned a lot both from the experience and my team.
